2021-04-16 12:40:05,PEP 💬 Every manager plays the way they believe. Frank did an incredible job. First season he couldn't sign players. He had an incredible run in the Champions League. I admire them both. Tomorrow I face Thomas. He knows how much I admire him. It will be a good battle.,0,21,306,

2021-03-12 13:45:24,"PEP 💬 Why do you not have to play football? Maybe I'm wrong, but these guys are saying to their team, you're good enough to go there to try and win the game. Other managers say now, we're going to sit back. Scott Parker went to Anfield and tried to play. That's quite remarkable.",0,25,332,
2021-03-12 13:42:52,"PEP 💬 They are working a lot to find a solution, but the grass isn’t good. All the players know how good the grass is and sometimes it is not. There are stadiums where the grass is good. Arsenal, Anfield, Old Trafford - even Budapest, the grass is better. Our grass is not good.",0,26,350,

2021-03-12 13:40:36,"PEP 💬 Sometimes the players have the ability to provoke falls. This is a talent too. It is the refs job to decide. It is one of the toughest jobs they have. The game is faster than ever. That is why VAR is there, to wait ten seconds and have a look.",0,13,191,
2021-03-12 13:39:29,PEP 💬 Nobody guaranteed with 11 players in the 18 yard box that you’ll have the success to win. Nobody knows that. That's why I prefer it as a spectator. I think all the new generation of managers are saying we’ll do our game rather than wait to see what the opponents do.,0,14,140,
2021-03-12 13:38:40,PEP 💬 Okay. Just defend with ten players behind the 18-yard box. They can do that. If I was a spectator I would prefer to watch the first fifteen minutes of Southampton. They have the courage to play. That doesn’t mean you don’t defend.,0,16,158,
2021-03-12 13:37:46,"PEP 💬  All the new generation of managers have this quality. All the managers in Germany and Spain play like they manage Bayern Munich. Sometimes they can't do it. You have the idea that you are going to lose a lot of games, but you are going win the games you need to.",0,15,158,
2021-03-12 13:36:36,"PEP 💬 A lot. It is what I admire the most. What I admire is that when it is not going well they continue to do it and at the end the results come. They make the sport nice, when both teams want to attack and create, not just wait for one mistake.",0,15,167,
2021-03-12 13:35:55,"PEP 💬 I'm going to tell you a secret, the Manager of the Month and Player of the Month is because we win games. It is not that Gundo is better than another player in the league or I'm a better manager. It's simply, the players behind and the backroom staff who help us win games.",0,21,211,
2021-03-12 13:34:34,"PEP 💬 In my fifth season in England, I have never seen the lower teams with this quality of play. We saw it with Southampton. The way they play is incredible. I saw it here with Fulham. The pace they play with, the organisation.",0,18,191,
2021-03-12 13:33:47,"PEP 💬 Since day one, they have played incredibly well. They were relegated with Scott and at the end of the season they were promoted. In English football there are incredibly good managers with Mr Potter at Brighton and Scott at Fulham. Many of them have courage to play.",0,18,214,

2021-03-09 13:39:59,PEP 💬 It was a lovely journey. All three options were there. Congrats to President Laporta for being elected. His personality will introduce a good mood. I wish him all the best for this season and the next seasons.,0,34,563,
2021-03-09 13:36:42,"PEP 💬 I didn't watch the game. Maybe we will play in the FA Cup. Firstly because I don't have time. I watch many Southampton games. The quality they do, we suffered a lot to beat them there. We will have to do a good performance tomorrow to get the result.",0,19,208,
2021-03-09 13:36:15,PEP 💬 It’s not a bad moment. A bad moment is playing bad and not getting results in a lot of games. We are close - every team is fighting for something. We are seeing how tough the games are. Tomorrow will not be an exception.,0,21,228,
2021-03-09 13:35:29,"PEP 💬 Maybe. I will decide tomorrow [Aguero and Foden to start]. I have an idea of course about who will play, but tomorrow I will decide.",0,39,357,
2021-03-09 13:34:46,"PEP 💬 No, absolutely not. Even when we win, it’s forgotten. When we lose, the same. We are not going to be depressed - it’s football. You can lose games. The not normal thing is what we have done [winning run].",0,21,205,
2021-03-09 13:34:01,PEP 💬 There is still a lot of work to do to arrive in the last games in contention to win the Premier League. We are alive in all competitions. It doesn't matter what happens tomorrow - of course we want to win - but there are still many games.,0,17,169,
2021-03-09 13:33:31,"PEP 💬 Mix of disappointment, sadness. Second day was better and today completely on fire. It’s a common reaction. Everyone realised how difficult it is to win good games, to do a good run. We did it and now we focus on the next one.",0,13,172,
2021-03-09 13:32:56,"PEP 💬 Yeah, of course, when the option is open, everything can happen in football. United can do it, absolutely agree. We have ten games left and we have to win six or seven to do it mathematically.",0,14,177,
2021-03-09 13:32:29,"PEP 💬 No, we will score 18. 18-0 will be the result...what a question! They conceded nine...come on be serious. We will try to win the game!",0,26,199,
2021-03-09 13:31:48,PEP 💬 No run exists. It’s one game at a time. We play Southampton and try to do a good game. I am a big fan of the style Ralph and the way his team play. It’s another test to play good and try to win.,0,15,203,
